`UFFFiles.jl` is a Julia package for reading and writing Universal File Format (UFF) files, commonly used in engineering applications.

::: {.callout-warning}
The package is under active development and is developed as part of my research activities.
:::

## Supported formats
Currently, `UFFFiles.jl` supports reading and writing UFF files with the following blocks:

* Dataset 15
* Dataset 18
* Dataset 55
* Dataset 58
* Dataset 82
* Dataset 151
* Dataset 164
* Dataset 2411
* Dataset 2412
* Dataset 2414

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/maucejo/UFFFiles.jl).

To make contributions easier, please provide `*.unv` or `*.uff` files that can be used as test cases for the new features or bug fixes.

## Acknowledgements

The creation of `UFFFiles.jl` was driven by the need to handle UFF files in Julia for processing the experimental data that I collect during my research activities.
This package take some inspiration from two wonderful packages : [pyuff](https://github.com/pyNastran/puyff) written in Python and [uff](https://github.com/murmlgrmpf/uff) written in Matlab. However, UFFFiles.jl is a completely new development, with its own design choices, which leverages of Julia's strengths and provides a native solution for handling UFF files in the Julia ecosystem.

For testing and validate the package, I used several UFF files that are publicly available online, including some provided by [pyuff](https://github.com/pyNastran/puyff) and some coming from my own experimental campaigns. For this reason, I would like to thank all the people who made these files available. This also explains why bugs may still be present in the package, as I do not have access to all possible UFF file variations.
