## v0.3.0

**Breaking changes**

- `conversion_factors` field in `Dataset164` struct has been modified in favor of individual names for scaling factors. This change improves fields clarity. Thanks to [@JakeZw](https://github.com/Spectrum-Tec) for submitting the PR.

- `node_coords` field in `Dataset15` struct has been changed from `Vector{Vector{Float64}}` to `Matrix{Float64}` for easier manipulation of node coordinates and consistency with `Dataset2411`.


## v0.2.1
